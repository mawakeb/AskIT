CSE1105 Group 44 
Code of Conduct

We should always respect each other and their culture and do not speak offensively or aggressively. Avoid discussing controversial topics during development of the project.
Everyone’s opinions should be considered, so always speak up when there is an idea or suggestion. If someone else disagrees with your opinion, don’t take it personal.
When making a major decision, we should always get an agreement from all members. If there is a difference in the agreement, we should try to look for a solution that most people agree with.
Everyone should try to be contacted easily and respond to important group messages/announcements. We should check the discord server daily and respond to important messages directed at the team.
Unless there is a special occasion, we should attend all group meetings. Try to be on time and do not come later than 10 minutes without notice.
Every member is expected to finish their assigned work before the deadline. We will try to divide the work equally as possible. Do not take over other’s work.
If you need help, ask questions to other members or the TA. However, this does not mean other members will endlessly help you in every single detail.
Everyone informs others of the work they are currently doing and is clear about the outcome of his work.
Every team member abides the git guidelines established during the lectures and every verbal agreement the team makes that is not included in the code of conduct.


Try to follow the code of conduct at all times.
