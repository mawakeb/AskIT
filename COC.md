# CSE1105 Group 44 Code of Conduct

1. We should always respect each other and their culture and do not speak offensively or aggressively. Avoid discussing
   controversial and irrelevant topics during development of the project (example: political topics).
2. Everyone’s opinions should be considered, so always speak up when there is an idea or suggestion. If someone else
   disagrees with your opinion, don’t take it personal.
3. When making a major decision, we should always try to get an agreement from all (5) members. If there is a difference
   in the agreement, we should try to look for a solution that everyone agrees with mostly. If a member makes a decision
   on his own terms, he/she has to revert it if the team disagrees with the decision.
4. Everyone should try to be contacted easily and respond to important group messages/announcements. We should check the
   discord server daily and respond to important messages directed at the team. If someone does not respond within a
   day(24h), his opinion will not be considered.
5. Unless there is a special occasion, we should attend all group meetings. Try to be on time and do not come later than
   10 minutes without notice.
6. Every member is expected to finish their assigned work one day(24h) before the deadline. We will try to divide the
   work equally as possible. Do not take over other’s work.
    * If someone is stuck, others should help him to achieve the goal before the deadline. The helpee should try to make
      up for the time it took to help them.
    * If the person has a valid reason to not finish on time, the team should be notified beforehand, so the work can be
      fairly distributed.
7. If you need help, ask questions to other members or the TA. However, this does not mean other members will endlessly
   help you in every single detail.
8. Everyone informs others of the work they are currently doing and is clear about the outcome of his work. Each member
   should keep up with the issue board and inform others using it.
9. Every team member abides the git guidelines established during the lectures.
10. Code of conduct can be updated in the future. Everyone should keep up with the updates and follow them.
11. Everyone should do tests/checkstyle before doing a merge request.
12. After creating a merge request, the person making it assigns 2 random people to review it. The assignees should review the merge request within 1 day. If the person has a valid reason not to make it within a day, a different person should be reassigned in his place.
13. From 12:00 to 18:00 (outside of lecture hours) everyone should be available. If the person is not available during at least 4 of these 6 hours, it should be announced by them beforehand.
14. New implemented methods and features should have at least 1 test that verifies its functionality. If the person struggles to write tests, he can ask someone else to add tests to his branch before merging.

## Consequences for breaking the COC

1. Discuss what caused the problem.
2. Every team member gives advice that could solve the issue.
3. If the issue reoccurs, we discuss it during the TA meeting.
4. Additional consequences are specific to each rule.

Try to follow the code of conduct at all times.
