**Must have**

- Students are able to ask questions that are visible to everyone.
- Students can upvote questions. This is to help lecturers get an overview of what the important questions are.
- A lecturer can open a one-time lecture room and invite people with a link. Lecturers can mark a question when they
  answer verbally.
- Then the question will become hidden, so it can prevent clusters in the chat.
- Multiple lectures can take place in separate rooms at the same time, since some lectures are overlapping.

**Should have**

- Lecturers and moderators can delete questions to avoid rude, answered or irrelevant questions.
- Students can delete their own question, but cannot edit it. This is to let students delete answered questions but
  prevent changing the question that they got the upvotes for.
- Questions can be ordered with a priority algorithm (takes upvotes, age etc. to account). This is to help lecturers
  decide which question to answer first.
- There will be two links that the lecturers can create, one for the moderators and himself and another for the
  students.
- Moderators can also answer straightforward questions in text and mark them as answered.
- This saves time for the lecturers.
- A lecturer can schedule a lecture that starts and ends at a certain time in advance and keep the link for the lecture
  room.

**Could have**

- Moderators can rephrase questions to help lecturers understand the question.
- Students can give feedback on how fast the lecture is going. Adding this function helps the lecturer to get notified
  when the lecture is too slow or fast passively.
- Lecturers can create a poll for everyone to check their studentsâ€™ understanding.
- Questions can be tagged by topic to group related questions. This provides insight to what questions are the most
  asked and also allows a lecturer to answer related questions after another.
- Moderators can merge the same question asked by different students.
- Lecturers can postpone questions.
- Answered questions will be moved to a different tab where everyone can check what questions were asked previously.
  This can become even more helpful if moderators could summarize what the lecturers said for some questions with a lot
  of upvotes.
- Have different accessibility features for visually impaired
- Lecturer can make custom link name endings
