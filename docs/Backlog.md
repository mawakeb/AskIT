**Must have**

- Students are able to ask questions that are visible to everyone. 
- Students can upvote questions. This is to help lecturers get an overview of what the important questions are.
- A lecturer can open a one-time lecture room and invite people with a link. 
- There will be two links that the lecturers can create, one for the moderators and himself and another for the students. 
- Lecturers can mark a question when they answer verbally.
- Multiple lectures can take place in separate rooms at the same time, since some lectures are overlapping. 
- A lecturer or a moderator can close a lecture room. Once a lecture is closed, students cannot ask new questions but a moderator/lecturer can still edit/answer questions.
- There are different views for users and moderators/lecturers 
- Lecturers can enable presenter mode

**Should have**

- Lecturers and moderators can delete questions to avoid rude, answered or irrelevant questions. 
- Students can delete their own question, and can edit. This is to let students delete answered questions and edit typos. However, they cannot edit/delete once it has been marked answered. 
- Questions can be ordered with a priority algorithm (takes upvotes, age etc to account). This is to help lecturers decide which question to answer first. 
- A lecturer can schedule a lecture that starts at a certain time in advance and keep the link for the lecture room. 
- Moderators can rephrase questions to help lecturers understand the question.
- Students can give feedback on how fast the lecture is going. Adding this function helps the lecturer to get notified when the lecture is too slow or fast passively.
- Answered questions will be moved to a different tab where everyone can check what questions were asked previously. This can become even more helpful if moderators could summarize what the lecturers said for some questions with a lot of upvotes. (answer in text after it was marked as answered by lecturer)
- Moderators can ban students from asking questions 
- Students can add nickname for themselves 
- Moderators can turn on “slow mode”. It makes the students timeout after asking a question, to maintain the speed of the chat. 
- The service should be persistent 
- Data is saved on restart
- Each lecture is saved and can be accessed later by the link
- Crashes shouldn’t lose too much data
- Anyone can export all questions and answers as a text file. This is to keep data persistent and allow users to save them to follow recorded lectures.
- There are relative timestamps next to questions (when a question was asked and later when it was answered). This helps students to follow the recorded lecture and look for answers in the lecture. 

**Could have**

- Lecturers can create a poll for everyone to check their students’ understanding. The polls will only have multiple choices, and no open questions.
- Moderators can also answer straightforward questions in text and mark them as answered. This saves time for the lecturers. After answering in text, the moderator can either mark it as answered or leave it unanswered.
